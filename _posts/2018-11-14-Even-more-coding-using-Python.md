Title Even more coding using Python Date 02/10/18

Starting point: I had only completed a couple of question on battleships level.

Target for this lesson? We had to carry on coding on python

Did I reach my target? Yes, I have now completed nine levels of python

How did you use your learning habits this week?

Persevering I tried hard to figure out the code with limited time.

Questioning? I asked myself what the correct code might be.

Independence I worked by myself nearly the entire lesson.

Reflecting I reflected on the css flaw and made the necessary corrections.

Engagement I was focused for the whole lesson.

What could have gone better in your learning?

I had to leave for a music lesson and only got half as much work done as possible but I still got through a lot of levels. Also I could of concentrated harder on the certain level I was on.

What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?

In future lessons, I should not procrastinate the level and come back to it later, I should work on it until I get it right.
