    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I didn't know how to use strings properly using python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To carry on coding in Python, whilst the teacher marked our blogs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I now know how to use strings with a better understanding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I did not know how to create strings in Python so I tried different code to get the correct one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was asking myself what the best and most reasonable code would be.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked by myself during the lesson, without asking the teacher for the answer for making strings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I can comfortably code a string without support or answers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was focused for the whole lesson and got another section complete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was taking a long time figuring out what the code might be and once getting the answer, realising it was plain and simple. I could of tried reordering my code to make it work.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to read the instructions in python more carefully so that I can try different tactics, rearrange my ode and to rethink of what the correct code might be so that, from now on I can easily get the simple answers.</td>
    <td></td>
